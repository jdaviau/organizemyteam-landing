The season is ending, and it's time to show parents and board members where all that money went. A clear, comprehensive end-of-season financial report builds trust, provides transparency, and sets up your successor (or yourself) for success next year.

This guide walks you through creating a professional financial report, with a template you can customize for your team.

## Why End-of-Season Reports Matter

Beyond just "showing your work," a good financial report:

- **Builds trust** with parents who contributed money
- **Demonstrates accountability** to the organization
- **Provides historical data** for future budget planning
- **Protects you** from questions or accusations later
- **Helps transitions** if the treasurer role changes

A treasurer who provides clear financial reports is a treasurer who gets thanked rather than questioned.

## What to Include in Your Report

### 1. Executive Summary

Start with a high-level overview that busy parents can scan in 30 seconds:

- **Total income** for the season
- **Total expenses** for the season
- **Net result** (surplus or deficit)
- **Current balance** in team accounts
- **Key highlights** (major purchases, unexpected costs)

Example:

> *"The 2024-25 Spring Soccer season generated $8,450 in income against $7,890 in expenses, resulting in a $560 surplus. Our current account balance is $1,240. Major expenses included new goals ($1,200) and tournament travel ($2,100)."*

### 2. Income Breakdown

Detail where money came from:

| Source | Budgeted | Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Registration fees | $5,000 | $5,200 | +$200 |
| Monthly dues | $2,400 | $2,250 | -$150 |
| Fundraising | $1,000 | $800 | -$200 |
| Sponsorships | $500 | $200 | -$300 |
| **Total** | **$8,900** | **$8,450** | **-$450** |

Notes to include:
- Why variances occurred (more/fewer players, fundraiser shortfall, etc.)
- Any outstanding payments still expected
- Changes from the original plan

### 3. Expense Breakdown

Show where money was spent:

| Category | Budgeted | Actual | Variance |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| League fees | $1,500 | $1,500 | $0 |
| Field rental | $1,200 | $1,400 | +$200 |
| Equipment | $1,000 | $1,200 | +$200 |
| Uniforms | $800 | $750 | -$50 |
| Tournaments | $2,000 | $2,100 | +$100 |
| Coaching | $500 | $500 | $0 |
| Administrative | $200 | $140 | -$60 |
| Contingency | $500 | $300 | -$200 |
| **Total** | **$7,700** | **$7,890** | **+$190** |

For each significant variance, provide a brief explanation.

### 4. Account Status

Provide current balances and any pending transactions:

- **Checking account**: $1,240
- **Pending deposits**: $0
- **Outstanding checks**: $0
- **Net available**: $1,240

If you have multiple accounts or sub-accounts, break these out separately.

### 5. Outstanding Items

List anything unresolved:

**Amounts owed to the team**:
- Smith family: $75 (final dues, contacted 3x)
- Tournament refund expected: $100

**Amounts the team owes**:
- Coach reimbursement pending: $45

### 6. Budget vs. Actual Analysis

Provide a brief analysis of how the budget performed:

> *"Overall, we stayed within 3% of our total budget. The main variance was field rental, which increased mid-season when our primary field became unavailable. This was offset by coming in under budget on uniforms due to a team discount.*

> *Fundraising fell short of our goal, primarily due to the car wash being rained out. For next season, I recommend budgeting fundraising more conservatively or having a backup event planned."*

### 7. Recommendations for Next Season

Based on this season's experience, suggest adjustments:

1. **Budget field rental higher** to account for potential increases
2. **Collect tournament fees earlier** to avoid cash flow issues
3. **Set fundraising targets lower** or plan backup events
4. **Maintain current dues structure** which proved adequate
5. **Build reserve fund** by carrying forward this year's surplus

### 8. Appendices

Include supporting documentation:

- Bank statements (or summary)
- Receipt summary for major purchases
- Roster of payments by family
- Copy of original budget for reference

## Presentation Tips

### Format for Readability

- Use tables for financial data
- Include charts if helpful (pie chart for expense categories works well)
- Bold key numbers
- Keep explanations concise

### Prepare for Questions

Common questions you might receive:

- "Why did [expense] cost more than expected?"
- "What happened to the fundraising money?"
- "How does this compare to last year?"
- "What's the money being held for?"

Have answers ready, with documentation to support them.

### Choose the Right Venue

Depending on your team's structure:

- **Email distribution**: For routine annual reports
- **Board meeting**: For approval and questions
- **Parent meeting**: For teams wanting more engagement
- **All of the above**: For maximum transparency

## Using Software to Generate Reports

While you can create reports manually, financial management software like Team Manager can generate professional reports automatically:

- **Instant reports**: Generate at any time, not just end of season
- **Accurate data**: Pulls directly from your transaction records
- **Professional format**: Clean, consistent presentation
- **Export options**: PDF, Excel, or printable formats
- **Historical comparison**: Easy comparison across seasons

The time saved on report preparation alone often justifies the software investment.

## Final Thoughts

A good financial report doesn't need to be complicated—it needs to be clear, accurate, and complete. Parents and board members want to trust that their money was handled responsibly. Your report provides that assurance.

Take time to prepare a thorough report. Future treasurers will thank you for the historical record, parents will appreciate the transparency, and you'll have documentation protecting you from any future questions.
