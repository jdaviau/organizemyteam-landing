Asking people for money is awkward. As a team treasurer, you know this all too well. You're a fellow parent, not a bill collector, yet here you are sending yet another reminder about overdue dues.

The good news? With the right approach, you can collect payments effectively while maintaining positive relationships. This guide covers the etiquette of payment reminders—when to send them, what to say, and how to handle the inevitable difficult situations.

## Understanding Why Parents Pay Late

Before diving into techniques, it helps to understand why payments are late:

- **Forgot**: Life is busy, and your email got buried
- **Financial difficulty**: They want to pay but can't right now
- **Confusion**: They're not sure what they owe or how to pay
- **Procrastination**: It's on their list, just not done yet
- **Oversight**: They thought their spouse handled it

Notice that most of these aren't hostile or intentional. Approaching reminders with empathy sets the right tone.

## The Ideal Reminder Schedule

Timing matters. Too few reminders and payments slip through. Too many and you're annoying. Here's a balanced schedule:

### Before the Due Date

**2 weeks before**: Informational reminder
> "Just a friendly reminder that Spring Season dues of $150 are due on March 1st. You can pay online at [link] or bring a check to practice."

**3 days before**: Gentle nudge
> "Quick reminder: dues are due this Friday, March 1st. Let me know if you have any questions about your balance."

### After the Due Date

**Day 1 past due**: Assume oversight
> "Hi! Wanted to check in—our records show your dues payment might still be outstanding. If you've already sent it, please let me know so I can update our records."

**1 week past due**: More direct
> "Following up on the Spring Season dues. We show a balance of $150. Can you let me know when we can expect payment?"

**2 weeks past due**: Offer options
> "I noticed we haven't received the dues payment yet. If there's a timing issue, I'd be happy to discuss a payment plan. Please reach out so we can get this resolved."

**3+ weeks past due**: Escalate or involve coach
> "I need to follow up on the outstanding balance. Please contact me this week so we can discuss options."

## Writing Effective Reminders

### Start with Connection

Don't lead with money. A brief friendly opening helps:

- "Hope you had a great weekend!"
- "Great game on Saturday!"
- "Looking forward to the tournament next week."

Then transition to the business matter.

### Be Clear About What's Owed

Ambiguity causes delays. Always include:

- Specific amount owed
- What it's for
- Due date (or how late it is)
- Payment options

Example:
> "Your account shows a balance of $150 for Spring Season registration dues. This was due on March 1st (10 days ago). You can pay online at [link] or bring a check made out to [Team Name] to Tuesday's practice."

### Make It Easy to Pay

Remove friction:

- Include direct payment links
- Accept multiple payment methods
- Offer to answer questions
- Provide clear instructions

### Avoid Accusatory Language

**Instead of**: "You haven't paid your dues."
**Try**: "Our records show the dues payment may still be outstanding."

**Instead of**: "This is your third reminder."
**Try**: "Following up on my previous message about the balance."

**Instead of**: "Payment was due two weeks ago."
**Try**: "The due date was March 1st, and I want to make sure we get this resolved."

### Provide an Out

Give people a graceful way to explain:

- "If you've already sent payment, please let me know so I can update our records."
- "If there's a timing issue, I'm happy to discuss options."
- "Please let me know if there are any questions about the amount."

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Financial Hardship

Some families genuinely can't pay. Approach with compassion:

> "I understand things can be tight. Would a payment plan help? We could split this into three monthly payments if that works better for your family."

If your team has scholarship funds, this is the time to mention them—privately and sensitively.

### Repeat Non-Payers

Some families are chronically late. Document everything and involve your board:

1. Send reminders according to schedule
2. Document all communication
3. After multiple attempts, escalate to coach or board
4. Follow your team's policy consistently

### "I Already Paid" Disputes

Stay calm and fact-based:

> "Thank you for letting me know. I don't have a record of that payment. Can you tell me when it was sent and the method used? That will help me track it down."

If they insist but you have no record, ask for proof (bank statement, cancelled check). Most genuine payments can be verified.

### Hostile Responses

Occasionally someone responds angrily. Don't match their tone:

> "I understand this is frustrating. I'm just trying to make sure our records are accurate and that we can cover the team's expenses. Can we find a time to talk through this?"

If someone is consistently hostile, involve your coach or board president.

## Automating Reminders

The best way to remove awkwardness? Automate reminders.

When reminders come from "the system" rather than you personally:

- It feels less personal and accusatory
- Everyone gets consistent treatment
- You don't have to remember who needs reminders
- You can honestly say "the system sends automatic reminders"

Tools like Team Manager let you set up reminder schedules that run automatically. You still handle the difficult cases personally, but routine reminders happen without your involvement.

## Sample Scripts

### Initial Reminder (Before Due Date)

> Subject: Spring Season Dues Reminder
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> Just a friendly reminder that Spring Season dues of $150 are due on March 1st.
>
> You can pay online at: [link]
> Or bring a check made out to [Team Name] to any practice.
>
> Let me know if you have any questions!
>
> [Your Name]
> Team Treasurer

### First Past-Due Reminder

> Subject: Following Up - Spring Season Dues
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I wanted to follow up on the Spring Season dues. Our records show a balance of $150 that was due on March 1st.
>
> If you've already sent payment, please let me know so I can update our records. Otherwise, here are the ways to pay:
>
> - Online: [link]
> - Check: Made out to [Team Name]
>
> Thanks for taking care of this!
>
> [Your Name]

### Past-Due with Payment Plan Offer

> Subject: Outstanding Balance - Let's Discuss Options
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm following up on the Spring Season dues balance of $150. I know things get busy, and I want to make sure we can find a solution that works for your family.
>
> If a single payment isn't feasible right now, we can arrange a payment plan—just let me know what would work best.
>
> Please reply or give me a call so we can get this resolved.
>
> Thanks,
> [Your Name]
> [Phone number]

### Final Notice

> Subject: Important: Outstanding Balance Needs Attention
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I need to follow up urgently on the outstanding dues balance of $150. We've sent several reminders, and I want to resolve this before it becomes a bigger issue.
>
> Please contact me this week to discuss payment or payment arrangements. If I don't hear from you by [date], I'll need to involve our coach/board to determine next steps.
>
> I'm sure we can work this out. Please reach out.
>
> [Your Name]
> [Phone number]

## Building a Culture of On-Time Payment

Prevention is easier than collection. Set expectations early:

1. **Communicate clearly** at season start about amounts and due dates
2. **Make payment easy** with online options and clear instructions
3. **Send timely reminders** before things are due
4. **Enforce consistently** so families know expectations are real
5. **Follow through** on stated consequences

Teams with clear, consistent policies have far fewer collection issues than teams where payment timing is negotiable.

## Conclusion

Collecting payments doesn't have to damage relationships. With clear communication, empathy, and consistent follow-up, you can maintain collection rates while keeping parent relationships positive.

The key is remembering that most late payments aren't intentional—and approaching each situation as a problem to solve together rather than a conflict to win.
