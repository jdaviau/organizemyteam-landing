Payment tracking is the heart of Team Manager. This overview explains how the system tracks what families owe, what they've paid, and what's still outstanding.

## How Payment Tracking Works

Team Manager uses a simple ledger system:

1. **Charges** are amounts families owe (from payment types)
2. **Payments** are amounts families have paid
3. **Balance** is the difference (charges minus payments)

When a family's balance is zero, they're paid in full. Positive balance means they owe money. Negative balance means they've overpaid.

## The Payment Dashboard

Your payment dashboard shows:

- **Total expected**: Sum of all charges across all families
- **Total collected**: Sum of all payments received
- **Outstanding**: What's still owed (expected minus collected)
- **Collection rate**: Percentage of expected payments received

This gives you an instant view of your team's financial health.

## Member Balances

Each family has an individual balance showing:

- Current amount owed
- Payment history
- Upcoming due dates
- Payment status (paid, partial, overdue)

You can view balances from the team dashboard or drill into individual member pages for details.

## Payment Status

Family payment status is calculated automatically:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Paid** | Balance is zero or negative |
| **Partial** | Some payment made, balance remaining |
| **Due** | Payment expected, not yet received |
| **Overdue** | Past due date, balance remaining |

Status updates in real-time as you record payments.

## Payment Timeline

For each family, you can see a timeline of:

- When charges were added
- When payments were made
- When reminders were sent
- Current status

This history helps resolve disputes and track communications.

## Filtering and Sorting

View payments by:

- **Status**: Paid, partial, overdue
- **Payment type**: Dues, tournaments, etc.
- **Date range**: This week, this month, custom
- **Member**: Individual family view

## Quick Actions

From the payment dashboard, you can:

- Record a new payment
- Send a reminder to overdue families
- Export payment data
- Generate payment reports

## Best Practices

### Record Payments Promptly

Record payments as soon as you receive them. This keeps balances accurate and prevents double-collection.

### Use Consistent Methods

Decide how you'll record different payment types (check numbers, transaction IDs) and stick to that system.

### Review Weekly

Check your payment dashboard at least weekly to:
- See new payments
- Identify overdue accounts
- Track collection progress

### Back Up Receipts

For cash and check payments, keep physical records as backup. Team Manager's records are reliable, but documentation is always smart.
