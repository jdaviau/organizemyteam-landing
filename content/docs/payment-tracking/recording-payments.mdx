Recording payments accurately is essential for maintaining trust with families and keeping your books balanced. This guide covers everything you need to know about logging payments in Team Manager.

## Recording a Payment

### From the Dashboard

1. Click **"Record Payment"** on your dashboard
2. Select the family from the dropdown
3. Choose the payment type
4. Enter the amount received
5. Select the payment method
6. Add any notes
7. Click **"Save"**

### From a Member Page

1. Go to **Team → Members**
2. Click on the family's name
3. Click **"Record Payment"**
4. The family is pre-selected; fill in other details
5. Click **"Save"**

## Payment Details

### Amount

Enter the exact amount received. This might be:
- The full amount owed
- A partial payment
- An overpayment (for credits)

Team Manager handles all scenarios and adjusts balances accordingly.

### Payment Method

Select how the payment was made:

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash** | Physical currency received |
| **Check** | Paper check received |
| **Bank transfer** | Direct deposit, wire, ACH |
| **PayPal/Venmo** | Digital payment apps |
| **Credit card** | Card payment (Square, Stripe, etc.) |
| **Other** | Any method not listed |

### Payment Date

By default, today's date is used. You can change this to:
- Backdate payments received earlier
- Record when the check was dated (vs. received)

### Notes

Use notes to record:
- Check numbers
- Transaction IDs
- Special arrangements
- Anything relevant for your records

**Example notes:**
- "Check #1234"
- "PayPal transaction ABC123"
- "Partial payment - remaining due by 4/1"
- "Applied scholarship - $50 covered by club"

## Special Situations

### Partial Payments

When a family pays less than owed:

1. Record the amount actually received
2. The remaining balance updates automatically
3. Add a note about the arrangement if relevant

**Example:** Family owes $150, pays $75
- Record payment of $75
- Balance shows $75 remaining
- Family sees updated balance

### Overpayments

When a family pays more than owed:

1. Record the full amount received
2. Balance will show a negative number (credit)
3. Credit can apply to future charges

**Example:** Family owes $100, pays $150
- Record payment of $150
- Balance shows -$50 (credit)
- Next charge of $50 would be covered

### Multiple Payment Types

When a family pays for multiple things at once:

**Option 1: Single payment, split later**
- Record total amount as single payment
- Allocate to primary payment type
- Note other items covered

**Option 2: Multiple payments**
- Record separate payment for each type
- Each shows independently in history

Either approach works—choose what's clearer for your records.

### Applying Past Credits

If a family has a credit (negative balance):

1. New charges automatically apply against credit
2. If charge exceeds credit, remaining amount is owed
3. If credit exceeds charge, credit remains

### Returned Checks / Failed Payments

If a payment doesn't clear:

1. Go to the payment record
2. Click **"Delete"** or **"Void"**
3. Balance reverts to original amount
4. Add note about the returned payment
5. Contact family about replacement payment

## Bulk Recording

For efficiency with many payments:

1. Go to **Payments → Bulk Entry**
2. Enter family/amount pairs quickly
3. Apply same date and method to all
4. Review and confirm

This is useful for:
- Processing a stack of checks
- Recording multiple online payments
- End-of-registration rush

## Editing Payments

Made a mistake? You can edit:

1. Find the payment in history
2. Click **"Edit"**
3. Correct the information
4. Save changes

All edits are logged for accountability.

## Deleting Payments

To remove a payment:

1. Find the payment in history
2. Click **"Delete"**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Balance adjusts automatically

**When to delete:**
- Duplicate entry
- Returned check
- Recording error

**When NOT to delete:**
- Refund (record as negative payment instead)
- Dispute (investigate first)

## Best Practices

### Be Consistent

Develop a routine:
- Record payments same day received
- Use consistent note formats
- Review entries weekly

### Document Everything

For each payment, you should be able to answer:
- Who paid?
- How much?
- For what?
- How (cash, check, etc.)?
- When?

### Keep Physical Records

Team Manager is your system of record, but also:
- Photocopy or scan checks
- Keep cash receipt copies
- Screenshot online payments

### Reconcile Regularly

Compare Team Manager records to:
- Bank statements
- Physical receipts
- Online payment records

Address discrepancies immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### Balance doesn't look right

1. Check payment history for the family
2. Verify all charges are applied
3. Look for duplicate payments
4. Check for voided/deleted entries

### Payment not appearing

1. Confirm it was saved (not just entered)
2. Check you're viewing correct team/season
3. Verify the date range in your view
4. Check if payment was voided

### Family disputes payment

1. Show payment history with dates
2. Provide transaction details from notes
3. Cross-reference with bank/receipt records
4. Adjust if error is found
