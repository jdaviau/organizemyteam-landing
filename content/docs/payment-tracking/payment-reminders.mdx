Chasing late payments is one of the most awkward parts of being a treasurer. Team Manager's automated reminders handle this for you, sending professional, consistent messages without the personal discomfort.

## Why Use Automated Reminders?

### Remove the Awkwardness

When reminders come from "the system," it's not personal. Parents understand you're not singling them out—everyone gets the same treatment.

### Save Time

No more:
- Checking who owes what
- Composing individual emails
- Tracking who you've reminded
- Following up on follow-ups

### Improve Collections

Consistent reminders lead to faster payments. Families appreciate the heads-up before due dates and gentle nudges after.

## Setting Up Reminders

### Access Reminder Settings

1. Go to **Settings → Reminders**
2. You'll see reminder configuration options

### Create a Reminder Schedule

A typical schedule includes:

| Timing | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| 7 days before due | Advance notice |
| 1 day before due | Final reminder |
| 1 day past due | First overdue notice |
| 7 days past due | Follow-up |
| 14 days past due | Urgent notice |

### Configure Each Reminder

For each reminder in your schedule:

1. **Timing**: Days before/after due date
2. **Subject line**: What recipients see
3. **Message**: The reminder content
4. **Recipients**: Who receives it (by status)

## Writing Effective Reminders

### Before Due Date

**Tone**: Informational, helpful

**Example:**
```
Subject: Upcoming: Spring Soccer Dues Due March 1

Hi {family_name},

This is a friendly reminder that Spring Soccer dues of {amount} are due on {due_date}.

You can pay by:
- Check made out to "Lightning Soccer Club"
- Bring to practice Tuesday or Thursday

Questions? Just reply to this email.

Thanks!
{team_name} Team
```

### On Due Date

**Tone**: Direct, action-oriented

**Example:**
```
Subject: Payment Due Today: {payment_type}

Hi {family_name},

Today is the due date for {payment_type}. Your current balance is {balance}.

Please arrange payment at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your prompt attention!
```

### Past Due

**Tone**: Professional, understanding

**Example:**
```
Subject: Past Due: {payment_type} Balance

Hi {family_name},

Our records show an outstanding balance of {balance} for {payment_type}, which was due on {due_date}.

If you've already sent payment, please let us know so we can update our records. Otherwise, please arrange payment as soon as possible.

If you need to discuss payment arrangements, please reply to this email.

Thank you,
{team_name}
```

## Customizing Messages

### Available Variables

Use these placeholders in your messages:

| Variable | Replaced With |
|----------|---------------|
| `{family_name}` | Family/member name |
| `{amount}` | Amount for this payment type |
| `{balance}` | Total outstanding balance |
| `{due_date}` | Payment due date |
| `{payment_type}` | Name of the payment |
| `{team_name}` | Your team name |

### Best Practices

- Keep messages concise
- Include payment instructions
- Provide a way to respond
- Don't be threatening or aggressive
- Acknowledge they may have already paid

## Managing Recipients

### Who Receives Reminders?

By default, reminders go to families with:
- Outstanding balance for that payment type
- Email address on file

### Excluding Families

You can exclude specific families from reminders:

1. Go to the family's member page
2. Find reminder settings
3. Toggle off reminders

**When to exclude:**
- Payment plan in progress
- Scholarship pending
- Known financial hardship
- Special arrangement

### Manual Sends

Beyond automated schedules, you can send reminders manually:

1. Go to **Payments → Send Reminders**
2. Select recipients (all overdue, specific families)
3. Choose or customize message
4. Send

## Tracking Reminders

### Reminder History

View sent reminders:

1. Go to **Communications → Sent**
2. Filter by type (reminder)
3. See who received what, when

### Per-Family View

On each family's page:
- See reminders they've received
- Dates sent
- Links to message content

This helps when families say "I never got a reminder."

## Advanced Options

### Reminder Frequency Limits

Prevent over-messaging:

- Set maximum reminders per month
- Require minimum days between reminders
- Stop reminders after X attempts

### Escalation

For chronic non-payers:

1. Standard reminders run automatically
2. After threshold (e.g., 30 days), flag for manual follow-up
3. You receive notification to intervene personally

### Team-Wide Communications

Beyond individual reminders, send to everyone:

- Status updates
- Deadline announcements
- Thank-you messages

## Troubleshooting

### Family didn't receive reminder

Check:
1. Email address is correct and active
2. Family not excluded from reminders
3. Reminder was actually scheduled to send
4. Check spam folder on their end

### Reminder sent to wrong amount

1. Verify balance is correct in system
2. Check for unrecorded payments
3. Update records and send correction

### Family asks to stop reminders

1. Respect their request
2. Exclude from automated reminders
3. Note that they're still responsible for payment
4. Follow up manually if needed

## Best Practices

### Start Early

Begin reminders before due dates, not after. Prevention beats collection.

### Be Consistent

Same rules for everyone. Perceived favoritism damages trust.

### Provide Options

If someone can't pay, offer:
- Payment plans
- Scholarship information
- Contact for discussion

### Know When to Stop

Automated reminders have limits. After several attempts:
- Personal phone call
- Involve coach or board
- Follow your team's delinquency policy
