Before diving deep into Team Manager, it helps to understand the key concepts and terminology we use. This page explains how everything fits together.

## Teams

A **team** is the top-level organization unit in Team Manager. It represents a single sports team for a single season.

### When to Create a New Team

- Each season typically gets its own team (e.g., "Lightning U12 Spring 2025")
- Different age groups or divisions are separate teams
- Travel vs. rec teams are separate teams

### Team Settings

Each team has its own:
- Roster of members
- Payment types and amounts
- Expense categories
- Reminder schedules
- Financial reports

### Multiple Teams

If you manage multiple teams (different age groups, multiple seasons), each gets its own space. You can switch between teams from your dashboard.

## Members

A **member** represents a family unit on your team. In most cases, this corresponds to one player and their paying parent(s).

### Member Information

For each member, you can track:
- **Player name**: The child on the team
- **Primary contact**: Parent/guardian name
- **Email**: For communications and reminders
- **Phone**: Optional, for urgent contact
- **Notes**: Any relevant information

### Member Balance

Each member has a **balance** showing what they owe or have overpaid:
- Positive balance = they owe money
- Zero balance = paid in full
- Negative balance = they've overpaid (credit)

The balance updates automatically as you record payments and add new charges.

## Payment Types

A **payment type** defines a category of money you're collecting from families.

### Common Payment Types

- **Registration dues**: The main seasonal fee
- **Tournament fees**: Per-tournament charges
- **Equipment fees**: Uniforms, gear, etc.
- **Travel expenses**: Hotel, transportation costs
- **End-of-season events**: Party, banquet fees

### Payment Type Properties

Each payment type has:
- **Name**: What it's called
- **Amount**: Standard amount owed
- **Due date**: When payment is expected
- **Description**: Optional notes about what it covers

### Assigning Payment Types

When you create a payment type, you can:
- **Apply to all members**: Everyone owes this amount
- **Apply to specific members**: Only selected families owe
- **Apply individually**: Add to members one at a time

## Payments

A **payment** is a record of money received from a family.

### Payment Details

Each payment records:
- **Who paid**: Which member/family
- **Amount**: How much was received
- **Date**: When it was received
- **Method**: Cash, check, online, etc.
- **Payment type**: What it's for
- **Notes**: Check numbers, transaction IDs, etc.

### Payment Methods

Team Manager supports tracking payments received via:
- Cash
- Check
- Bank transfer
- PayPal/Venmo
- Credit card
- Other

The method is for your records—Team Manager tracks the payment regardless of how it was made.

## Expenses

An **expense** is money spent on behalf of the team.

### Expense Details

Each expense records:
- **Amount**: How much was spent
- **Date**: When the expense occurred
- **Category**: What type of expense
- **Description**: What it was for
- **Vendor**: Who was paid
- **Receipt**: Attached documentation
- **Paid by**: Who paid (for reimbursements)

### Expense Categories

Default categories include:
- Equipment & supplies
- Field/facility rental
- League & tournament fees
- Travel & transportation
- Coaching & training
- Administrative
- Events & celebrations
- Other

You can customize categories to match your team's needs.

## Reports

**Reports** transform your data into useful summaries and documents.

### Report Types

- **Financial summary**: Income vs. expenses overview
- **Payment status**: Who's paid, who owes, how much
- **Member statements**: Individual family payment history
- **Expense report**: Where money was spent
- **Budget comparison**: Planned vs. actual

### Report Formats

Reports can be:
- Viewed on screen
- Exported to PDF
- Downloaded as Excel/CSV
- Emailed to recipients

## Reminders

**Reminders** are automated messages sent to families about payments.

### Reminder Types

- **Upcoming due date**: Sent before payment is due
- **Past due**: Sent after payment is overdue
- **Custom**: Sent manually for special communications

### Reminder Settings

Configure:
- **Schedule**: How many days before/after due date
- **Frequency**: How often to remind
- **Message**: What the reminder says
- **Recipients**: Who receives it

## Putting It Together

Here's how everything connects:

1. You create a **team** for your season
2. You add **members** (families) to your roster
3. You set up **payment types** for what you're collecting
4. **Balances** are calculated automatically
5. As families pay, you record **payments**
6. As you spend, you record **expenses**
7. **Reports** show you the big picture
8. **Reminders** help you collect outstanding amounts

## Best Practices

### Start of Season
1. Create your team
2. Set up all payment types with due dates
3. Import or add your roster
4. Balances are now ready to track

### During Season
1. Record payments as they come in
2. Track expenses as you spend
3. Let reminders run automatically
4. Check dashboard weekly for status

### End of Season
1. Collect remaining balances
2. Generate financial report
3. Archive or close the team
4. Start fresh next season
