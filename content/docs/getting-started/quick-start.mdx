This guide will walk you through setting up Team Manager from scratch. By the end, you'll have your team ready to track payments.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to [app.organizemyteam.com/signup](https://app.organizemyteam.com/signup)
2. Enter your email and create a password
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete your profile (name, phone number)

**Tip:** Use an email you check regularly—this is where you'll receive notifications about payments and reminders.

## Step 2: Create Your Team

Once logged in, you'll be prompted to create your first team:

1. Click **"Create Team"**
2. Enter your team name (e.g., "Lightning U12 Soccer")
3. Select your sport (optional but helpful for organization)
4. Choose your season (Spring 2025, Fall 2024, etc.)
5. Click **"Create"**

You now have a team dashboard ready for action.

## Step 3: Set Up Payment Types

Before adding members, define what you'll be collecting:

1. Go to **Settings → Payment Types**
2. Click **"Add Payment Type"**
3. Enter the details:
   - **Name**: Registration Dues, Tournament Fee, etc.
   - **Amount**: The amount owed per family
   - **Due Date**: When payment is expected
4. Repeat for each type of payment you'll collect this season

**Example setup for a typical season:**

| Payment Type | Amount | Due Date |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Registration Dues | $150 | March 1 |
| Tournament Fee | $50 | April 15 |
| End-of-Season Party | $25 | May 1 |

## Step 4: Add Your Roster

Now add the families on your team. You have two options:

### Option A: Import from Spreadsheet

If you have an existing roster:

1. Go to **Team → Import Members**
2. Download our CSV template
3. Fill in your roster data
4. Upload the completed CSV
5. Review and confirm the import

### Option B: Add Manually

For smaller rosters or one-off additions:

1. Go to **Team → Members**
2. Click **"Add Member"**
3. Enter:
   - Player name
   - Parent/guardian name
   - Email address
   - Phone number (optional)
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Repeat for each family

**Tip:** Use parent emails for primary contact—they're the ones paying!

## Step 5: Record Your First Payment

When you receive a payment:

1. Go to **Payments → Record Payment**
2. Select the family
3. Choose the payment type
4. Enter the amount received
5. Select the payment method (cash, check, online)
6. Add any notes (check number, transaction ID)
7. Click **"Record Payment"**

The family's balance updates automatically, and you have a record for your files.

## Step 6: Check Your Dashboard

Return to your team dashboard to see:

- **Total collected** vs. total expected
- **Outstanding balances** by family
- **Recent activity** and payments
- **Quick actions** for common tasks

## What's Next?

You're all set up! Here are recommended next steps:

### Set Up Reminders

Don't chase payments manually. [Configure automated reminders](/docs/payment-tracking/payment-reminders) to notify families about upcoming and overdue payments.

### Track Expenses

Keep a complete picture of team finances by [recording expenses](/docs/expense-management/tracking-expenses) as they occur.

### Generate Your First Report

Try [generating a financial report](/docs/reports/financial-reports) to see your team's financial status at a glance.

## Common Questions

### Can I add another treasurer or manager?

Yes! Go to **Settings → Team Members** and invite them by email. You can assign different permission levels.

### What if I make a mistake?

All transactions can be edited or deleted. Go to the transaction detail page and click "Edit" or "Delete." Changes are logged for your records.

### How do I handle partial payments?

Record the amount actually received. Team Manager will track the remaining balance automatically.

### Can families pay online?

Team Manager tracks payments regardless of how they're made. For online payment processing, you can integrate with services like PayPal or Venmo and record those payments in Team Manager.
