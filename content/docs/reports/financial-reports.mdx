## Report Tips

### Know Your Audience

- **Board**: Detailed, includes variances
- **Parents**: Summary, visual, highlights
- **League**: Required format, specific data

### Tell a Story

Don't just present numbers—explain them:
- What happened?
- Why?
- What does it mean?
- What's next?

### Be Consistent

Use same format each time:
- Easier comparison
- Sets expectations
- Looks professional

### Include Context

Numbers without context can mislead:
- "Expenses up 20%" (because we added a tournament)
- "Collection rate 85%" (typical for mid-season)

## Troubleshooting

### Report shows wrong totals

1. Check date range
2. Verify all transactions recorded
3. Check for filtered data
4. Regenerate report

### Report missing data

1. Ensure data was entered
2. Check category assignments
3. Verify date range includes transactions
4. Look for filtering

### Can't export

1. Try different browser
2. Check popup blockers
3. Ensure report generated first
4. Contact support if persists
