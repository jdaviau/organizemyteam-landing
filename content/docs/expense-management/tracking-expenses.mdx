Tracking expenses is just as important as tracking income. Team Manager helps you record every dollar spent, categorize expenses, and generate reports showing where your money goes.

## Why Track Expenses?

### Complete Financial Picture

Income without expenses is only half the story. To know your team's true financial health, you need both sides.

### Accountability

When parents ask "where did the money go?", you can show them—in detail.

### Better Budgeting

Historical expense data helps you create more accurate budgets for future seasons.

### Tax and Audit Readiness

If your organization needs documentation for taxes or audits, you're prepared.

## Recording an Expense

### From the Dashboard

1. Click **"Add Expense"**
2. Fill in expense details
3. Upload receipt (optional but recommended)
4. Click **"Save"**

### Expense Details

For each expense, record:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Amount** | How much was spent |
| **Date** | When the expense occurred |
| **Category** | Type of expense |
| **Description** | What it was for |
| **Vendor** | Who was paid |
| **Paid by** | Who made the purchase |
| **Receipt** | Documentation |

### Example Entry

```
Amount: $245.00
Date: March 15, 2025
Category: Equipment & Supplies
Description: Practice cones, pinnies, ball bag
Vendor: Amazon
Paid by: Coach Martinez
Receipt: [Uploaded]
Notes: Reimbursement due to coach
```

## Expense Categories

### Default Categories

Team Manager includes common categories:

- **Equipment & supplies**: Balls, cones, goals, etc.
- **Field/facility rental**: Practice and game venues
- **League & tournament fees**: Registration, entry fees
- **Travel & transportation**: Gas, bus, tolls
- **Coaching & training**: Clinics, certifications
- **Uniforms & apparel**: Jerseys, warm-ups
- **Administrative**: Software, banking, printing
- **Events & celebrations**: Parties, awards, banquets
- **Other**: Anything else

### Custom Categories

Add categories specific to your team:

1. Go to **Settings → Expense Categories**
2. Click **"Add Category"**
3. Enter name and description
4. Save

### Sub-Categories

For detailed tracking, create sub-categories:

- Travel
  - Gas/fuel
  - Hotel
  - Meals
  - Tolls

## Attaching Receipts

### Why Keep Receipts?

- Proof of purchase
- Reimbursement documentation
- Audit trail
- Dispute resolution

### How to Attach

1. When adding expense, click **"Upload Receipt"**
2. Select file (image or PDF)
3. Receipt is attached to expense record

### Mobile Upload

Use your phone to:
1. Take photo of receipt
2. Upload directly to expense
3. Never lose another receipt

### Receipt Best Practices

- Upload immediately after purchase
- Ensure legibility (amount, vendor, date visible)
- Store physical originals temporarily as backup

## Handling Reimbursements

When someone pays with personal funds:

### Recording the Expense

1. Add expense as normal
2. Set **Paid by**: Person's name
3. Note "Reimbursement pending"

### Processing Reimbursement

1. When you pay them back, record a separate expense
2. Category: "Reimbursement" or add to original category
3. Note: "Reimbursement to [Name] for [original expense]"

### Alternative: Single Entry

Some prefer recording only when the team actually pays:

1. Wait until reimbursement is processed
2. Record expense at that time
3. Note original purchase date in description

Choose whichever method works for your tracking style.

## Recurring Expenses

For regular expenses (monthly field rental, etc.):

### Option 1: Manual Entry

Record each occurrence separately. More work but complete record.

### Option 2: Recurring Setup

1. Create expense
2. Mark as recurring
3. Set frequency (weekly, monthly, etc.)
4. System creates entries automatically

### Review Recurring

Periodically verify:
- Amount hasn't changed
- Expense still applies
- Dates are correct

## Budget Tracking

### Linking to Budget

When you have a budget:

1. Assign expenses to budget categories
2. Dashboard shows budget vs. actual
3. Alerts warn when approaching limits

### Over Budget?

When a category exceeds budget:

1. Review if expenses are necessary
2. Consider reallocating from underspent categories
3. Communicate with board if significant

## Expense Reports

### Quick Summary

Dashboard shows:
- Total expenses this period
- By category breakdown
- Recent expense activity

### Detailed Reports

Go to **Reports → Expenses** for:
- Full expense list
- Category summaries
- Date range filtering
- Export options

## Best Practices

### Record Promptly

Record expenses as they happen:
- Less chance of forgetting
- Receipt is in hand
- Details are fresh

### Use Descriptive Notes

Instead of "Equipment," write "12 practice cones and ball pump - replacement for broken items"

### Categorize Consistently

Decide where borderline expenses go and stick to it. If "referee fees" is under League Fees, always put it there.

### Review Monthly

At minimum, review expenses monthly:
- Verify all recorded
- Check categorization
- Compare to budget
- Look for anomalies

### Keep Backup Records

In addition to Team Manager:
- Save receipt images locally or in cloud
- Keep bank/card statements
- Maintain spreadsheet backup if desired

## Troubleshooting

### Missing expense

1. Check date range in view
2. Verify it was saved (not just entered)
3. Check other categories
4. Review bank/card records

### Wrong category

1. Find the expense
2. Click **"Edit"**
3. Change category
4. Save

### Duplicate expense

1. Compare entries for same amount/date
2. Verify only one was actual purchase
3. Delete duplicate
