Expense categories help you organize spending, generate meaningful reports, and compare across seasons. This guide covers how to use and customize categories effectively.

## Why Categories Matter

### Clear Reporting

"We spent $5,000" is less useful than "We spent $2,000 on equipment, $1,500 on field rental, and $1,500 on tournaments."

### Budget Tracking

Categories let you set and track budgets for specific spending areas.

### Historical Comparison

Compare "equipment spending this year vs. last year" to spot trends and plan better.

### Accountability

Show families exactly where their money went, broken down by purpose.

## Default Categories

Team Manager includes these standard categories:

| Category | Typical Expenses |
|----------|------------------|
| **Equipment & Supplies** | Balls, cones, goals, first aid, training gear |
| **Field/Facility Rental** | Practice fields, game venues, gym rental |
| **League & Tournament Fees** | League registration, tournament entry, referee fees |
| **Travel & Transportation** | Gas, bus rental, tolls, parking |
| **Coaching & Training** | Clinics, certifications, coaching fees |
| **Uniforms & Apparel** | Jerseys, shorts, warm-ups, bags |
| **Administrative** | Software, bank fees, printing, postage |
| **Events & Celebrations** | End-of-season party, awards, banquet |
| **Other** | Miscellaneous expenses |

## Customizing Categories

### Adding a Category

1. Go to **Settings → Expense Categories**
2. Click **"Add Category"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: What to call it
   - **Description**: What belongs here
   - **Color**: For reports (optional)
4. Click **"Save"**

### Editing a Category

1. Go to **Settings → Expense Categories**
2. Find the category
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. Make changes
5. Save

Existing expenses in that category remain; they'll show the updated name.

### Deleting a Category

1. Go to **Settings → Expense Categories**
2. Find the category
3. Click **"Delete"**
4. Choose what happens to existing expenses:
   - Move to another category
   - Mark as "Uncategorized"

**Caution**: Don't delete categories with significant expenses unless you have a plan for them.

## Category Strategies

### Keep It Simple

Too many categories = more work, harder to compare. Start with 6-10 categories and add only if needed.

### Be Specific Enough

Too few categories = less useful data. "Miscellaneous" shouldn't be your biggest category.

### Match Your Budget

Your expense categories should align with your budget categories. If you budget for "field rental," have that as an expense category.

### Consider Reporting

Think about what reports you'll want:
- What questions will the board ask?
- What do parents want to know?
- What will help next year's planning?

## Common Custom Categories

Teams often add:

- **Referee/Official Fees**: If significant and separate from league fees
- **Snacks/Water**: Team snacks, water bottles
- **Photography/Media**: Team photos, video
- **Insurance**: Separate liability coverage
- **Storage**: Shed rental, storage unit
- **Fundraising Expenses**: Costs of running fundraisers

## Categorization Tips

### Consistent Decisions

Decide once, apply everywhere:

| Expense | Category Decision |
|---------|-------------------|
| Referee fees | League Fees (not Administrative) |
| Team photo | Events (not Administrative) |
| Gas for away game | Travel (not Other) |
| Software subscription | Administrative |

Document your decisions so you're consistent all season.

### When Unsure

Ask yourself:
1. What was the primary purpose?
2. Where would I look for this later?
3. What does the board expect?

### Splitting Expenses

Sometimes one purchase spans categories:

**Example**: $100 Amazon order with $60 cones + $40 first aid supplies

**Option 1**: Record as single expense in primary category (Equipment), note "includes first aid supplies"

**Option 2**: Record two expenses, one per category

For small amounts, option 1 is fine. For significant mixed purchases, option 2 gives better data.

## Using Categories in Reports

### Category Summary

Dashboard shows:
- Pie chart of spending by category
- Table with amounts
- Percentage of total

### Detailed by Category

In Reports, filter by category to see:
- All expenses in that category
- Sorted by date or amount
- Running total

### Budget Comparison

If you've set a budget:
- Each category shows budget vs. actual
- Over/under indicator
- Remaining amount

## Seasonal Analysis

At end of season:

### Review Category Totals

1. Generate expense report
2. Review each category
3. Note surprises (higher or lower than expected)

### Identify Trends

Compare to previous seasons:
- Which categories grew?
- Which shrank?
- Any one-time expenses to exclude?

### Inform Next Budget

Use this season's actuals to set next season's budget:
- Categories that ran over need bigger budgets
- Categories consistently under might be trimmed
- New categories might be needed

## Best Practices

### Review Regularly

Monthly, check that:
- Expenses are categorized (not sitting in "Other")
- Categories are used correctly
- Totals make sense

### Train Other Users

If multiple people enter expenses:
- Share your category decisions
- Provide examples
- Review their entries initially

### Annual Category Review

Before each season:
- Remove unused categories
- Add new ones if needed
- Update descriptions for clarity

## Troubleshooting

### "Other" is too large

1. Review expenses in Other
2. Identify patterns
3. Create new categories for common items
4. Re-categorize existing expenses

### Expenses in wrong category

1. Find the expense
2. Edit and change category
3. Save

Bulk re-categorization is available for multiple expenses.

### Category doesn't appear in reports

1. Verify expenses are assigned to it
2. Check date range in report
3. Ensure category isn't filtered out
