# Getting Started as an Organization Administrator

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the setup process for your Organization Administrator account, from initial account creation to activating your subscription.

## 1. Account Creation

The Team Manager support team will create a default Organization Administrator account for you. You'll receive an email confirmation when your account is ready.

**Important:** Account creation automatically starts your **7-day free trial**.

## 2. Reset Your Password

After receiving your account confirmation email, you'll need to set up your password:

1. Visit the password reset page: [https://app.organizemyteam.com/auth/reset-password](https://app.organizemyteam.com/auth/reset-password)
2. You'll receive an email with password reset instructions
3. Follow the instructions in the email to create your password
4. Log in with your new credentials

## 3. Explore Your Trial

As part of your 7-day trial, you're automatically assigned the **Core subscription** plan. This allows you to explore key features including:

- **Creating teams** - Set up and organize your teams
- **Assigning treasurers** - Delegate financial management responsibilities
- **Payment tracking** - Monitor and manage team payments
- **Expense management** - Track and categorize expenses
